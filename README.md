The project for me was taking sample data from a bike sharing dataset and applying regression to it. The data comes from bike sharing systems that track user movements, when and where they return their bike etc. The data collected from these bikes is valuable because it automatically becomes like a sensor network for movements of people throughout the city. For best models my work found that lightgbm (Light gradient boosting machine) was the best.
